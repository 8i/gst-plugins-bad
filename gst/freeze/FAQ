Freeze FAQ
==========

Q: freeze does not want to link to ximagesink: capsnego fails.
A: Check the caps, whether the framerate is zero. If it is, insert a
videorate element before freeze.

This is because freeze does not alter the caps, it just proxies them,
and if the source only supports a zero framerate, then freeze
supports only that, too.
